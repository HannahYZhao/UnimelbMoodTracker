        "ArticleContent": "What Is Happiness?\n\nHappiness is something that people seek to find, yet what defines happiness can vary from one person to the next. When most people talk about the true meaning of happiness, they might be talking about how they feel in the present moment or referring to a more general sense of how they feel about life overall.\n\nHappiness Definition:\nHappiness is an emotional state characterized by feelings of joy, satisfaction, contentment, and fulfillment. While happiness has many different definitions, it is often described as involving positive emotions and life satisfaction.\n\nBecause happiness tends to be such a broadly defined term, psychologists and other social scientists typically use the term \u0027subjective well-being\u0027 when they talk about this emotional state. Just as it sounds, subjective well-being tends to focus on an individual\u0027s overall personal feelings about their life in the present.\n\nTwo key components of happiness (or subjective well-being) are:\n\nThe balance of emotions: Everyone experiences both positive and negative emotions, feelings, and moods. Happiness is generally linked to experiencing more positive feelings than negative ones.\n\nLife satisfaction: This relates to how satisfied you feel with different areas of your life including your relationships, work, achievements, and other things that you consider important.\n\nAnother definition of happiness comes from the ancient philosopher Aristotle, who suggested that happiness is the one human desire, and all other human desires exist as a way to obtain happiness. He believed that there were four levels of happiness: happiness from immediate gratification, from comparison and achievement, from making positive contributions, and from achieving fulfillment.\n\nHow to Cultivate Happiness \n\nWhile some people just tend to be naturally happier, there are things that you can do to cultivate your sense of happiness.\n\nPursue Intrinsic Goals \nAchieving goals that you are intrinsically motivated to pursue, particularly ones that are focused on personal growth and community, can help boost happiness. Research suggests that pursuing these types of intrinsically-motivated goals can increase happiness more than pursuing extrinsic goals like gaining money or status.\n\nEnjoy the Moment\nStudies have found that people tend to over earn—they become so focused on accumulating things that they lose track of actually enjoying what they are doing. So, rather than falling into the trap of mindlessly accumulating to the detriment of your own happiness, focus on practicing gratitude for the things you have and enjoying the process as you go.Reframe Negative Thoughts\nWhen you find yourself stuck in a pessimistic outlook or experiencing negativity, look for ways that you can reframe your thoughts in a more positive way.

        "ArticleContent": "Toxic positivity is the belief that no matter how dire or difficult a situation is, people should maintain a positive mindset. While there are benefits to being optimistic and engaging in positive thinking, toxic positivity rejects all difficult emotions in favor of a cheerful and often falsely-positive façade.\n\nHaving a positive outlook on life is good for your mental well-being. The problem is that life isn\u0027t always positive. We all have painful emotions and experiences. Those emotions, while often unpleasant, need to be felt and dealt with openly and honestly to achieve acceptance and greater psychological health.\n\nToxic positivity takes positive thinking to an overgeneralized extreme. This attitude doesn\u0027t just stress the importance of optimism—it also minimizes and even denies any trace of human emotions not strictly happy or positive.\n\nToxic positivity means having a \"good vibes only\" approach to life and discarding any seemingly negative emotions. It denies people the authentic support they need to cope with what they are facing.\n\nExamples of Toxic Positivity\n\nToxic positivity can take a wide variety of forms. Some examples you may have encountered in your own life include:\n\nWhen something bad happens, such as losing your job, people may say to “just stay positive” or “look on the bright side.” While such comments are often meant to be sympathetic, they can shut down anything the other person might want to say about what they are experiencing.\n\nAfter experiencing some type of loss, people might say that “everything happens for a reason.” While people will make such statements because they believe they are comforting, this is also a way of avoiding the other person\u0027s pain. \n\nUpon expressing disappointment or sadness, someone may respond that “happiness is a choice.” This suggests that if someone is feeling negative emotions, it’s their own fault for not “choosing” to be happy.\n\n",

        "ArticleContent": "Happiness and health have been anecdotally linked for quite a while now—\"laughter is the best medicine\" has become a cliche\u0027 for a reason—but research backs up what many people have instinctively assumed all along: that happiness and health really are connected, and that one\u0027s level of happiness really can impact the level of one\u0027s health.\n\n“Experiences that induce positive emotion cause negative emotion to dissipate rapidly. The strengths and virtues…function to buffer against misfortune and against the psychological disorders, and they may be the key to building resilience. The best therapists do not merely heal damage; they help people identify and build their strengths and their virtues,” wrote Martin Seligman, former president of the American Psychological Association and the father of the field of positive psychology, in his book Authentic Happiness. And solid research continues to accumulate supporting this view. Here are a few important studies on happiness and health.\n\nHappiness and Longevity\n\nA landmark study involving nuns was able to pinpoint health benefits that come with positive emotion. (Nun studies work well because so many other lifestyle variables are uniform, so reported differences can often be narrowed down to a handful of factors, like personality and outlook.)\n\nIn studying the lives and deaths of the nuns, given clues to their emotional state, researchers were able to make an important discovery about happiness and health-positive emotion is correlated with longevity. Ninety percent of the most cheerful quarter of nuns was alive at the age of eighty-five, whereas only 34% of the least cheerful quarter lived to that age. Similarly, 54% of the most cheerful fourth was alive at age ninety-four, versus 11% of the least cheerful.\n\nHappiness and Marriage\n\nAs if that’s not enough, positive emotion is also linked by research to marital satisfaction. In another astonishing study, researchers were able to examine the cheerfulness of smiles in women’s yearbook photos and predict which ones, on average, would be more likely married, stay married, and experience more personal well-being over the next thirty years.(Hint: it was, again, the most cheerful group.) This is a great way that couples can keep each other healthy.Happiness and Optimism\n\nResearchers have also found optimists to have longer lives. Optimism is distinct from positive emotion, though the two are related. Rather than just being cheerful, however, optimists tend to see the world in a distinct way: when positive events occur in their lives, they give themselves personal credit, attribute the cause to lasting traits under their control, and see each good event as a sign that more positive events are to come.\n\nThis specific lens through which they see the world allows them to maintain more of an internal locus of control (a sense of personal control over things), as well as resulting health-promoting behaviors and is associated with many benefits, including longevity. One study found that optimists had a 15% longer lifespan on average. Clearly, happiness and health can be linked by optimism.\n\n",

        "ArticleContent": "Is it really possible to be depressed and not know it? After all, depression is a serious clinical diagnosis. In reality, it can be difficult to recognize signs of depression over common experiences like sadness or grief.\n\nDepression can appear suddenly or gradually. It can be related to a situation (as with adjustment disorders) or there may be no \"reason\" at all. You may be aware that you feel bad or not like your usual self, but you may not be aware that what you are feeling is clinically significant depression.\n\nWhy You May Not Know You\u0027re Depressed\n\nThere are several possible explanations for being depressed and not knowing it. Depression might not be on your radar, either due to denial or stigma, or you may dismiss your symptoms because you\u0027ve been experiencing them for so long. You may even be mistaking the symptoms of depression for something else.\n\nThe following are some reasons why you may not realize that you are depressed:\n\nYou\u0027ve been depressed for a while. If you have been depressed for a long time, it simply feels normal to you. This may be especially true for those who have been depressed since early childhood.\n\nYou don\u0027t feel sad. Because you may not be feeling particularly sad, you may think it can\u0027t possibly be depression. In reality, depression can take more forms than just a feeling of profound sadness. You may feel tired, low in energy, or lack in any real sense of joy without necessarily feeling sadness or being weepy.\n\nYour symptoms have developed slowly. Depression can develop gradually over an extended period of time. When the changes in mood are subtle and come on slowly, you may not recognize that things aren\u0027t the same as they used to be.\n\nYou feel down about yourself. If you are feeling like you are somehow bad or defective, it\u0027s easy to dismiss what you are feeling as somehow being an innate part of yourself that can\u0027t be fixed. You may feel that rather than struggling with a treatable illness, you are irreparably broken and unworthy of feeling better.\n\nYou have internalized attitudes about mental health. Cultural differences can also make it more difficult to recognize and acknowledge depression. If those around you treat depression as something that must be borne without complaint, then you may feel as if asking for help is a sign of weakness.\n\n",

        "ArticleContent": "Anxiety disorders are serious mental illnesses that cause significant worry or fear that doesn\u0027t go away and may even get worse over time. We all feel anxious at times, but with an anxiety disorder, the anxiety tends to be fairly constant and has a very negative and intrusive impact on quality of life.\n\nAccording to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), approximately 19.1% of adults in the United States have some type of anxiety disorder. Women are also more likely to be affected by anxiety, which is why experts now recommend that women and girls over the age of 13 should be screened for anxiety disorders as part of routine medical care.\n\nTypes of Anxiety Disorders\nThere are several types of anxiety disorders. While all are characterized by symptoms of anxiety, each has its own unique set of characteristics, symptoms, and criteria for diagnosis.\n\nAgoraphobia\nAgoraphobia is an irrational and extreme fear of being in a situation where escape is impossible. People often fear that they will experience symptoms of panic or other symptoms in public, which leads them to avoid any situation where they may feel panicked, helpless, or trapped.\n\nThese avoidance behaviors are often life-limiting, often causing people to avoid driving, shopping in public, air travel, or other situations. In some cases, this fear can become so severe that people are unable to leave their homes.\n\nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder\nGeneralized anxiety disorder (GAD) involves excessive worry and anxiety related to various activities and events. This worry is difficult to control and often shifts from one concern to another.\n\nWhile there is no specific threat, people with GAD find themselves feeling anxious about everyday daily events, current events in the news, relationships, or potential events that might occur.\n\nPanic Disorder\nPanic disorder involves experiencing intense and persistent panic attacks that occur unexpectedly with little or no warning. A panic attack has physical and emotional symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, increased respiration, and feelings of extreme terror.\n\nSelective Mutism\nSelective mutism is an anxiety disorder that occurs during childhood. It involves experiencing anxiety, embarrassment, or fear that prevents children from speaking in specific settings, such as while at school or around strangers.\n\nSelective mutism usually occurs between the ages of two and four and is often accompanied by fidgeting, lack of eye contact, and lack of expressions when faced with a situation the child fears. \n\nSocial Anxiety Disorder\nSocial anxiety disorder (SAD), previously known as social phobia, involves a fear of social situations. This fear may center on specific events, such as public speaking, or may involve a more generalized fear of many different social situations.\n\n\nPeople who have this condition have an exaggerated sense that other people scrutinize everything they do. They may be very critical of themselves and experience both physical and emotional symptoms of fear in social situations. \n\n\nSuch symptoms include shaking, racing heartbeat, stomach upset, and dread. These symptoms often lead people to avoid social situations whenever possible. ",

        "ArticleContent": "People tend to be social creatures, and research has shown that social connections are vital for both emotional and physical well-being. However, alone time also plays a pivotal role in mental health. Being around other people comes with rewards, but it also creates stress. You worry about what people think. You alter your behavior to avoid rejection and to fit in with the rest of the group. \n\nWhile it may be the cost of being part of a social world, some of these challenges demonstrate why alone time can be so important. Having time for yourself gives you the chance to break free from social pressures and tap into your own thoughts, feelings, and experiences.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated both the challenges of loneliness and a lack of solitary time. Where many people struggled with feelings of isolation and loneliness, others faced the challenges of suddenly spending a great deal of time in close quarters with family members or roommates. Blurred work-life boundaries and a lack of time apart meant that many people were suddenly struggling with a complete lack of alone time. \n\nWhy Alone Time Is Important\n\nFinding time to be alone can have a number of key benefits. Some of these include:\n\nPersonal exploration\nCreativity\nSocial energy\n\nPersonal Exploration\n\nBecoming comfortable in your own company can give you the time and freedom to truly explore your own passions without interference. It can be a way to try new things, research topics that fascinate you, acquire knowledge, and even practice new methods of self-expression.\n\nGiving yourself alone time means you can explore these things without the pressures and judgments that others may impose. Having time to yourself is critical for growth and personal development. Instead of worrying about the needs, interests, and opinions that others may have, alone time lets you focus on yourself.\n\nCreativity\n\nAlone time is an opportunity to let your mind wander and strengthen your creativity. Without the need to care for or interact with other people, you can ignore outside influences and focus inward.\n\nResearch actually suggests that being alone can lead to changes in the brain that help fuel the creative process. One study found that people who tend to purposely withdraw in order to spend time alone also tend to be highly creative people.\n\nIn a 2020 study published in the journal Nature Communications, researchers found that perceived social isolation (aka loneliness) led to increased activity in the neural circuits related to imagination. When left with a lack of social stimulation, the brain ramps up its creative networks to help fill the void.\n\nSocial Energy\n\nLiving alone tends to be seen in a negative light. However, researchers have found that people who live alone may actually have richer social lives and more social energy than people who cohabitate with others.\n\n\nIn his book “Going Solo,” sociologist Eric Klineberg notes that one in seven U.S. adults lives alone. Klineberg found that not only were these adults not lonely, many actually had richer social lives.\n\nReasons Being Alone Isn’t Always Easy\n\nAlone time can be challenging for some people for a variety of reasons. One study found that many people would prefer to give themselves painful electric shocks rather than just sit alone with their own thoughts. Some of these reasons people might struggle with being alone include:\n\n",

        "ArticleContent": "Most of us have a tendency to live in the past or the future. How often do you find yourself thinking about what happened yesterday, or what might happen tomorrow? How does this affect your life and well-being?\n\nIn this article, we will discuss how to live in the present moment more frequently, and some ways that can help you get back into living mindfully.\n\nNotice Your Surroundings\n\nOne way to be in the present moment is by noticing your surroundings. How often do you take time out of your day to actually look around and see what\u0027s going on? When was the last time you sat down, closed your eyes, took a deep breath, and just looked at everything around you?\n\nTake this opportunity right now: close both of your eyes and take a deep breath, then open them and really take in where you are.\n\nHow do the walls look?\nWhat about the floor or ceiling—what patterns can you see there?\nHow many windows are there to your left and right?\nHow many lights can you count from here?\nWhen you stop to look at your surroundings and take in everything around you, it\u0027s easier to live in the present moment.\n\nFocus on One Thing at a Time (Don\u0027t Multitask)\n\nWhile it may feel more productive to multitask and work on more than one thing at a time, constantly juggling multiple tasks makes it hard to live in the present moment. While doing something that requires your full attention can seem overwhelming at first, be aware of how much more productive you are when fully engaged in a task. Compare this with trying to squeeze multiple things into one period of time or spending half of your energy on three different projects.\n\nIf you\u0027re working on something, give it all of your attention. When you find yourself thinking about other things or checking your phone because you don\u0027t feel like doing the task at hand, stop and turn that focus back to what\u0027s in front of you. Research shows that when you are fully focused on what\u0027s happening at that moment, you can better remember details in the long term anyway.\n\nBe Grateful For What You Have Now\n\nPart of living in the present moment is taking the time to be grateful for what you have now (not in the past or in the future). If you are constantly focused on things you don\u0027t have, you aren\u0027t taking the time to appreciate what you have right now at this moment.\n\nOne way to practice gratitude is to write a list of things you are grateful for and review that list on a daily basis. Try to write at least three things you are grateful for in your life right now. Alternatively, you can do a gratitude rampage, where you write out as many things as you can think of in a certain time period.\n\nAccept Things As They Are (Not How You Want Them to Be)\n\nIf you want to start living in the present moment, you need to let go of how you think things should be and accept them for what they are. You cannot control everything that happens around you; sometimes life is going to be different than how you want it to be. Practicing acceptance will help you let go of the things in your life that are out of your control.\n\nPractice Mindfulness Meditation\nOne way to live more in the present moment is by practicing mindfulness meditation.3 This type of meditation helps people become aware and increase their concentration on what they are doing at any given time. Starting a daily meditation practice can help you become more aware of your thoughts and feelings, which can in turn increase the amount of time that you spend in the present moment.\n\n",
